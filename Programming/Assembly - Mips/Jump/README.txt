Lab 3: Looping in MIPS
CMPE 012 Summer 2018
Farahmand, Babak

-------------------------
(“Flux” and “Bunny”) are stored in the processor’s memory. After assembling your
program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored?
it ranges from 0x10010000 to 0x10010039

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
I think the objective of this lab was:
1: Learning the loop instruction, increment and decrement
2: Learning the Jump instruction and the usage of it
3: Learning  more about the Temporary registers
4: How to print a string vs integer


Did you encounter any issues?
Actually yes, at the beginning  I spent a lot of time solving the errors and learning more about the instructions and commands in this new programming language.

Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
Playing with jumps and seeing the output, after a hard programming time is always enjoyable

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think I would design it the way it is, it was very good, specially for beginners like me.
