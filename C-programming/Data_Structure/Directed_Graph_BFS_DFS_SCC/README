-------------------------

List.h  hold function declarations for List.c file

List.c hold functions and method and instruction to create and Impelment a doubly linked list

Digraph.h hold function declarations for Digraph.c file

Digraph.c hold functions and method and instruction to create and Impelment the data structure used to find SCC in the given graph

DigraphPropertires.c Hold a main file which is responsible to reading function and execute them.

Makefile holds instructions to compile files and create an executable version of those which have main funtion. it also has valgrinde run by: make checkGraph

Data Structure:

In this program I used a very simple array data structure that stores SCC numbers on the index 0 of each time that it finds an strongly connected component after running a DFS on the graph and revese version of it.
this data structore has an array with length of the graph (G->V + 1), from the index 1 till n it referes to verteces, and they are marked (value) of the related number of the SCC.

For example if vertex two '2' was found in SCC number 3 it assigns the value 3 to vertex 2, and it has the same value for all the verteces in the same SCC.

I used another data structore List, to store all the data with lagest finishing time in it, so it makes me able to pass this list to my DFS and get run my second dfs on the revesed graph with the right order.

Another data structure that I used.

here's my agorithm speeds

DFS = O(N + M)
SCCcount = O(1)
inSameSCC = O(1)
getCountSCCvertex = O(n)

There is a problem here, I'm using Xcode to run, these codes, and I'm getting everything right without error but on linux time share I'm getting.
Im posting it along my code, because I'm experiencing a lot of frustration, and sadness, I spent alot of time to come up with the cleanest code and best algorithm.
