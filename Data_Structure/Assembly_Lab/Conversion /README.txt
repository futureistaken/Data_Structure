CMPE 012 Fall 2018

-------------------------
What was your approach to converting each decimal number to twoâ€™s complement form?
The number was already in two's complement, so I just masked it and isolated each digit and print it out.

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to read from program argument, convert it to ascii and decimal, and do operation, and print it out back as an ascii character.
learning how to make a dictionary for morse and converting the sum of the decimal into morse code was also fun to see.

Did you encounter any issues?
I tested my program with various type of input, and started getting errors or bugs.
so I used debugger to debug my code line by line, and solve the problem.
sometime the problem occurs in a place that I never thought of, but Debugger was a savior.

Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
All of it was joyful], challenges, and solving problems one by one, was great, thanks for the great design.
I learned a lot about MIPS in this lab.
very time consuming.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I don't think that I could designe a better lab to make people understand how to place wih registers.
this was great, hard but useful, thanks.
