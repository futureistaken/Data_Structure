LAB 1: Intro to Logic Simulation
CMPE 012 Fall 2018
Farahmand, Babak Bfarahma
-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
1: A better understanding of how a logic gate works.
2: It is possible to create all the gates using only NAND and NOR.
3: Working with ML and learning how the transceiver and receivers works.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues? Everything was fine, I had a little bit of challenge while working with NAND and NOR.
The rest was fine, I learned most of these materials on my Discrete math. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better? I think it was a very useful and functional example, I couldn't designed a better lab for this topic.
