Lab 5: Subroutines
CMPE 012 Fall 2018

-------------------------
What was your design approach?
I copy pasted all the subroutine comments that they were given as to my program, read them carefully, spent a lot of time with TA's and classmates to unerstand the functionality of each subroutine

What did you learn in this lab?
I learn how Subroutine works, what $ra , jr , jal , pc etc are, and how to actually right a code in a different file and call it from another file.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I faced a lot of issues, for some reason the lab pdf wasn't clear to me, so I had to spent lots of hours with TA's to make sure every steps I go is actually is a correct step.
the joyable part was playing with stacks and seeing how powerful this language could be!

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
It was an awesome Lab! I loved it, I would work on the pdf (lab instruction to make it better and more understandable).
