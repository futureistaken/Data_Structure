What were the learning objectives of this lab?
Learning how to implement a comparator, conditional statement, full adders, 2’s compliment, and register.
Did you encounter any issues? 
I did a lot actually, but unfortunately because of the car accident couldn’t catch up with class. I have problems with adder, and register. I understood the compare part.
what parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
Learning from Cory, he is very awesome and so passionate about this job as a TA.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I’ll definitely need to work more and harder to fill the gap that I unintentionally created by the accident.
